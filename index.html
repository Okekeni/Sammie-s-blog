 <h2>Title: The Trip To Makurdi</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, they were two boys named Ada and Femi who came from a middle class family and lived in Lagos. There came a time they had to visit their grandmother that lives in Makurdi. So the two boys prepared for the journey and as they arrived at the park they paid for seats on a bus to Makurdi.<br><br>
Their journey began as early as 6am in the morning. They saw many things such as hills and rivers. They also saw the statue of great people from the past such as Obafemi Owoluwo. Their bus driver was smooth in driving until when a policeman stopped them on the way to check their luggages. The driver angrily drove through a tiny space but the was still lots of traffic, so he was blocked either way. The policeman angrily opened the door of the bus and he commanded the driver to come out. For the offence, he was taken to the station and we the passengers waited for four hours in the station before we could continue our journey. The place we waited wasn't comfortable at all because the station was near to a cow farm, where there were dunk everywhere with an offensive odour. Ade and femi kept talking to the driver to contol his temper, so it those not lead him to more trouble.<br><br>
So as they continued their journey, te bus driver stopped at a resturant so they could eat and regain their strenght to continue the journey. Ade wanted to eat but Femi wanted to use the toilet first and so both of them decided to use the toilet first. They were suprised, when the toilet attendant asked hem to pay #100 each for using the toilet. They went to the resturant and eat jollof rice and chicken with drinks. They also bought some snacks to eat during the remaining parts of the journey.<br><br>
Although they had travelled half way, they still had a long journey ahead. Seeing that Lagos tp Makurdi involves passing through diffeent states while travelling with a bus. The route is usually from Lagos through Oyo state, Osun< Ogun, Ekiti, Kogi, before Benue; of which Makurdi its state capital.<br><br>
As they approached Kogi state, which happens to be the last state before Benue state, it was already 10pm in the night ad so they were informed by the driver that they would not continue onthe their journey. With this news Ade and femi became really sad.<br><br>
The thought of the goddies Grandma would have prepared for them. Their favourite food of pounded yam and 'nune' soup. Their cousins whom they would have seen and would have shared stories and gifts. Their comfortable beds in thespecial room Grandma reserves for them and all.<br>
With this sadness in their hearts, the arranged themselves in the bus and spent a very uncomfortable night, sleeping in their sitted position.<br><br>
Morning couldn't have come any sooner. At about 5am, the bus driver woke everyone up. They went out, washed their faces, brushed their teeth and got back into the bus. There were no bathrooms to clean themselves.<br><br>
The journey this time was shorter, because Kogi to Benue is about 2 hours journey. As they rode in the quite of the morning, the driver decided to turn on the radio, he was just on time for the morning news. To their amazing, they were informed of a terrible robbery that took place on the highway between the hours of 10pm and 12 midnight which left many dead. The same road they were to take the previous day.<br><br>
Ade and Femi fell on their knees, thanking God. Even though the trip didn't happen as planned, the delay was a blessing in disguise</p>
